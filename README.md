Module assessment demonstrating routing with Express

This is a practice project using middleware verification 
and routing with Express. Spin up a local server at
port 5000 and send a **GET** request to the /urls path
to load the initial database data.

**POST** new additions with an "href": attribute in the json
body and **GET** them by their specific ID to see how the
/use path increments a new timestamp with each view.

Nothing will be saved locally all changes exist exclusively
in working memory.
